# Autonomus HR-ChatBot
## Description
HR ChatBot is an endeavor to create a prototype enterprise application that utilizes LLM (Large Language Model) and implements its concepts. This ChatBot is built using LangChain's agent and tool modules and powered by ChatGPT or gpt-3.5-turbo models, with Pinecone serving as the vector database. The user interface is developed using Streamlit and the streamlit_chat component. I provide three tools in this ChatBot: Timekeeping Policy, Employee Data, and Calculator. Each tool is accompanied by a description to assist the LLM in determining the specific situations where the tool is best suited. The more detailed the description, the better the results obtained.

The available tools are as follows:
- Timekeeping Policy: A sample HR policy document generated by ChatGPT. The document's embeddings are created using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model and stored in the Pinecone index.
- Employee Data: A CSV file containing dummy employee data (such as name, supervisor, number of leaves, etc.). The data is loaded as a Pandas DataFrame and manipulated by the LLM using LangChain's PythonAstREPLTool.
- Calculator: This is LangChain's calculator chain module, LLMMathChain.

## Instruction
1. Install python 3.9 or higher
2. Create [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) account and obtain your  [API_KEYS](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Replace the OpenAI API keys in the `.env.default` file with your own.
3.  Create a [Pinecone](pinecone.io) account there is a free tier. Take note of the Pinecone API and environment values. Replace the Pinecone API keys in the `.env.default` file with your own.
4.  Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired directory.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/fahmiaziz98/langchain_project.git
    ```
5. After the repository has been successfully cloned, navigate to the `autonomous-hr-chatbot` directory:
    ```
    cd langchain_project\autonomus-hr-chatbot
    ```
6. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
7. Run the Python script to store the embeddings:
    ```
    python store_embeddings.py
    ```
8. Finally, launch the chatbot's frontend by running the following command:
    ```
    streamlit run app_frontend.py
    ```
Make sure to replace the necessary API keys in the .env.default file and review any additional configuration steps mentioned in the project's documentation.
